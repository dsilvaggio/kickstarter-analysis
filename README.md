# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
  An Analysis was performed on kickstarter data in order to determine how different campaigns performed based on their launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose
  Louise, a new up and coming play-write, has used a crowd funding campaign in order to fund her new play "fever". After coming close to her fundraising goal, she is curious to know how other similar plays performed on crowd funding sites. 
## Analysis and Challenges 
  Before diving too far into the data, I first glanced through the raw data sheet in order to get an idea of the type of numbers and information that I was dealing with. I filtered the subcategory by plays, and as I was scrolling through I noticed right away that all play campaigns were either successful or has failed, none were cancelled. I then added a column titled "years" and used the 'YEARS()' function on Excel in order to pull the year that the campaigns were created. I saw that most play campaings were created between the years 2014 - 2017. While I did not have any challenges that arrised during my analysis, I could see the 'COUNTIFS()' function in Excel being rather tedious to use, if using it multiple times. I had to pay extra attention to detail when editing my formula in order to make sure that I was staying between the specified goal limits.
