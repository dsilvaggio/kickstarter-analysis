# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
  An Analysis was performed on kickstarter data in order to determine how different campaigns performed based on their launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose
  Louise, a new up and coming play-write, has used a crowd funding campaign in order to fund her new play "fever". After coming close to her fundraising goal, she is curious to know how other similar plays performed on crowd funding sites. 
## Analysis and Challenges 
  Before diving too far into the data, I first glanced through the raw data sheet in order to get an idea of the type of numbers and information that I was dealing with. I filtered the subcategory by plays, and as I was scrolling through I noticed right away that all play campaigns were either successful or has failed, none were cancelled. I then added a column titled "years" and used the 'YEARS()' function on Excel in order to pull the year that the campaigns were created. I saw that most play campaings were created between the years 2014 - 2017. While I did not have any challenges that arrised during my analysis, I could see the 'COUNTIFS()' function in Excel being rather tedious to use, if using it multiple times. I had to pay extra attention to detail when editing my formula in order to make sure that I was staying between the specified goal limits.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  In order to analyze the campaings success based on their launch date, I first needed to create a pivot table. I selected all of the date from the kickstarter sheet and created a pivot table in a new sheet named "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date". I filtered my table based on years and parent category. I set my columns to be the different outcomes and my rows were the Date Created Conversion column from the original kickstarter sheet. I made sure that the rows were organized by month and not year. The values in my table were the count of the different outcomes. I then filtered the parent category to show only the data for theater campaigns. I then created a line graph based on the date from the pivot table. By looking at the line graph, I was able to tell that theater campaigns had a higher amount of successful campaigns than failed ones. I could also see that the highset count of successful theater campaigns were ones created in May and then June respectively.
